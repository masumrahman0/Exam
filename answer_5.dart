/** Answer to the question number 5:
  
  Dart does not have a syntax for declaring interfaces. Class declarations are themselves interfaces in Dart. 
  Classes should use the implements keyword to be able to use an interface. 
  It is mandatory for the implementing class to provide a concrete implementation of all the functions of the implemented interface.
