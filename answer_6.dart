/** Answer to the question number 6:
  
   We can handle any error by using Exception Handaling.
   An exception is an error that takes place inside the program. 
   When an exception occurs inside a program the normal flow of the program is disrupted and it terminates abnormally, displaying the error and exception stack as output.
   So, an exception must be taken care to prevent the application from termination. 
   We can use this method for handling an error:
              1. try
              2. On
              3. Catch
