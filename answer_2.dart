   There are some reason of why using Dart- those are:
    
    1. Dart has a declarative and programmable layout that is easy to read and visualize. 
    2. Dart can also be compiled into JavaScript and it allows Flutter developers to use the code between mobile apps and web apps.
    3. Dart is a language that is excellent at compiling both AOT and JIT.
    4. Dart allows Flutter to avoid the need for a separate declarative layout language like JSX and XML.
